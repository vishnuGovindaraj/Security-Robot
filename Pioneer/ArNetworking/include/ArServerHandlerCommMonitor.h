/// Handler that enables the client to monitor communication to the robot server.
/** 
 * ArServerHandlerCommMonitor defines network packet handlers that simply verify
 * the communication between the robot and server.  
 * 
 * This class handles the following requests:
 *  <ul>
 *    <li>heartbeatTcp:  Packet broadcast (TCP) periodically to confirm that
 *                       the server is alive.</li>
 *    <li>heartbeatUdp:  Packet broadcast (UDP) periodically to confirm that 
 *                       the server is alive.</li>
 *    <li>getHeartbeatInterval: Command to return the expected heartbeat interval.
 *                              Packet contains:
 *                              <ol>
 *                              <li>uByte4 : Interval (msecs)</li>
 *                              </ol>
 *    <li>ackCommTcp:    Command to acknowledge two-way communication over TCP.
 *                       An empty packet is returned.</li>
 *    <li>ackCommUdp:    Command to acknowledge two-way communication over UDP.
 *                       An empty packet is returned.</li>
 *  </ul>
